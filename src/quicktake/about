                       Reject planned obsolescence!

Many thanks to my spouse Abi, for her support and patience while I spend
countless evening hours on pieces of software that are mostly proof of concept.
Thank you for being with me, and being as proud as I am of the progress I make!
I love you.

Thanks to my kids, who don't really get an appreciation of how much less is 
available on an Apple II than on the gaming PC with their eight-cores CPUs,
gigabytes of RAM, and terabytes of storage, but still sense that there's
something cool in this program.

Thanks to Pierre Dandumont for lending me Quicktakes 150 and 200, and letting
me have them long enough to implement their support. Your trust is appreciated!

Thanks to FozzTexx for extensive testing and debugging on a wide range of Apple
II machines.
