; General principles. we expect audio to be pushed on one serial port, video on
; the other. Execution flow  is controlled via the audio stream, with each
; received byte being the next duty cycle's address, as an index in the 'next' array.
;
; Duty cycle functions have to be page-aligned so their cycle count is predictible.
;
; There are 32 different duty cycles (0-31), each moving the speaker by toggling
; it on and off at a certain cycles interval (from 8 to 39).
; The tasks of each duty cycle handler is:
; - Toggle the speaker on, wait a certain amount of cycles, toggle it off
; - Fetch the next byte of audio
; - Fetch the next byte of video
; - If there is a video byte, handle it
;
; It is possible to lose audio bytes without horrible effects (the sound quality
; would just be badder), but every video byte has to be fetched and handled,
; otherwise the video handler, being a state machine, will get messed up.
; Reading the same audio byte twice has no big drawback either, but reading the
; same video byte would, for the same reasons.
; In accordance to that, we spare ourselves the cycles required to verify the
; audio serial port's status register and unconditionnaly read the audio serial
; port's data register.
;
; Hence, each duty cycle does the following:
; - Load whatever is in the audio data register into jump destination
; - If there is a video byte,
;    - Load it,
;    - Finish driving speaker,
;    - Waste the required amount of cycles
;    - Jump to video handler
; - Otherwise,
;    - Load audio byte again,
;    - Waste the required amount of cycles (less than in the first case),
;    - Jump to the next duty cycle.
;
; Keyboard handling is cycle-expensive and can't be macroized properly, so
; reading the keyboard in cycle 16. This cycle, being in the middle, is,
; hopefully, called multiple hundreds of time per second. It's also the "silence"
; level so keyboard handling works on silent videos.
;
; The video handler is responsible for jumping directly to the next duty
; cycle once the video byte is handled.
;
; Almost every reference to serial registers is direct, so every duty cycle
; (in duty-cycles/*.s) is patched in multiple places. The patched instructions
; are labelled like ad0 (audio data cycle 0), and they need to be in *_patches
; arrays (in audio-data, video-status-data and video-data-data files) to be
; patched at start.
; Hardcoded placeholders have $C0xx where $xx is the register's address low
; byte for my setup, for reference.
; vs = video status = $99 (printer port in slot 1)
; vd = video data   = $98 (printer port in slot 1)
; as = audio status = $A9 (modem port in slot 2)
; ad = audio data   = $A8 (modem port in slot 2)

; Warning about the alignment of the 32 duty cycles: as we read the next
; sample without verifying the ACIA's status register, we may read an
; incomplete byte, while it is being landed in the data register. They are read
; LSB to MSB, so, we have to align the duty cycles in a way that even when an
; incomplete read happens, we do not load the 'next' array out of bounds.
; This is why, here, we have the duty cycles range from 0 to 31:
; $00 = 00000000
; $1F = 00011111
