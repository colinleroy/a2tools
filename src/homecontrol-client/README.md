== HOMECTRL, a home control CLI for the Apple //c ==

This allows to control switches and climate in your home, and to look at sensors graphs.

This requires ../http-serial-proxy running on a helper computer connected to the Apple // via serial, and ../../a2domo running on a helper web server (can be the serial helper).

http-serial-proxy is because obvious reasons, and a2domo because I'm *not* trying to do JSON APIs with the Apple //.
