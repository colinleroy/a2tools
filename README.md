== Repository of stuff I write for my Apple //c ==

I'm having fun with this antiquity like it's 1989!

The Apple //c was my first computer and I loved it dearly
for years, but to be honest, it served little purpose these
last years, only decorating the office. But then my wife woke
up a monster by suggesting we do the Advent of Code, and we
started, and then I thought

"I should do it with the Apple //c!"

One thing led to another and there are now quite a few tools
here. Including an HomeAssistant frontend to control switches,
heating, and view sensors' graphs.
